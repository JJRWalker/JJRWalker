- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JJRWalker
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development and game development technologies
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a Vulkan based 2D C++ game engine in my spare time outside of work along with a game in said engine.
I started this project as a way to learn more about the game engines I used to work, with the hope that it would improve the code 
I wrote for those engines. Now I find myself much more interested in going through the whole process of making a game, and how
rewarding that can be.
